# Calendar Auditor

Calendar Auditor is my humble attempt at getting visibility into how my
calendar looks like over the past week(s).

You have time, you just need to [make time for time][1].

## What this is today

A simple script that summarizes the events that I have on my calendar for the
past 7 days, and tells me how much time I've spent in different type of
meetings.

Many things are still hard-coded (e.g. the type of events that I am tracking).

## What this will be someday

This should allow you specify the type of events that you want to track, and
categorize them for you accordingly.
