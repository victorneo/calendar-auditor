# Categories are defined in a YAML file, with the following format:
# <substring of event name on your Google Calendar>: Category name
#
# For example, if you have a series of business meetings on your calendar with
# the following format: "Meeting with A", "Meeting with B", you can track
# these in a single category with the following:
#
#     Meeting with: Business meetings
#
# If you have certain events that you want to ignore, you can add the
# substring of event names under the Ignore category.
#
Flight: Flight(s)
Planning: Planning work
Interview: Interview(s)

        - Ignore this
        - Ignore that
